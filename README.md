## KATA 1: anagram

Two regular words are considered as "anagram" if they contain both exact count of letters (each letter is used once)
e.g: ange => nage

A "palindrome" or "anacyclique" are specific anagram's types which can be read both sides
in order to:

-> create the same word 
kayak => kayak (palindrome)

-> give a new one
port => trop (anacyclique)

You have to implement isAnagram() (only function signature is provided) body in `src/kata/anagram/index.ts` to past successfully tests into `src/kata/anagram/__tests__/index.ts`

You can check the results of the test using that command

```
npm run kata:anagram:check

```

Expected complexity (worst case): O(n)
